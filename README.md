To set up this RTOS with GUI for user tracking simply flash the RTOS code file onto a Ram Cortex microcontroller like an STM32 or Arduino Nano. Connect the two sensors to the devices you would like to measure along with the relay on the device you would like to monitor overcurrent on. Then set up the ESP32, connect the Tx and Rx pins to the RTOS microcontroller and flash the ESP code file onto the controller. To set up the GUI first make a Google Sheet named whatever you would like with a sheet titled "Data". This will be the database where the readings of the sensor will be sent to be organized before reaching the website. Next in the extensions of the Google sheet launch App Scripts and paste the code provided in this Github then deploy. Once you deploy it will give you a web app link copy that link and paste it into the esp code on the line that says "const char* scriptURL" and change the wifi ssid and password for wherever you use this project. With that same link go into the docs folder of the repository and paste it again into the html file towards the bottom. Now for the website, go to Google Sites and make a new site, once created go to insert and then insert webapp url. Paste the link you get from the actions page once te index.html updates.
